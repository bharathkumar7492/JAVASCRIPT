// The rest parameter is used to group the remaining elements into an array.

// !  spread operator 

// The spread operator in JavaScript allows  to expand an array, object, or iterable into individual elements.

// It is often used to copy, merge, or pass elements.

// The spread operator is represented by three dots (...)

// ! shallow copy 

// A shallow copy of an object is a new object that is a copy of the original, but it only copies the references of nested objects instead of creating new instances. 

// This means that if the original object contains another object as a property, changes to the nested object in the copy will affect the original and vice versa.

//! deep copy

// A deep copy creates a completely independent clone of the original object, including all nested objects. Changes to the copied object do not affect the original.

let a4 = [50,60]

// let copy2 = [...a4]

let copy2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(a4))

copy2.push(100)
console.log(copy2)  // [50,60,100]
